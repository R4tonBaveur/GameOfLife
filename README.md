# Presentation
My Second java project(very poorly coded helped by my father). It's just a basic version of the game of life as described here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

# Rules
The game is composed of a grid of cells.
-If a dead cell(white cells) has exactly 3 neighboors on the next generation the cell will be born, it will be alive!
-If an alive cell(black cells) has 3 or 4 neighboors, it will survive to the next generation, otherwise it will die!
With thoses simple rules you can create funny little objects/mechanisme by example planners or logic gates (altough I think my grid is to small for this ^^)...

# How To Use The Game
You can either manually place cells or remove then by clicking with the mouse either use "Random Generation" to randomly fill the grid(with a probability of 0.5 for each cell to born). Then you can either use "Start" to make the game automaticly pass from the previous gen to the nextone, then use "Stop" to stop it, either use "Next Generation" which will create the next generation of cells. Finally you can use "clear" to kill all living cells on the grid.
I let the game with the default rules but you can modify them as well as the delay between two generations.

# Thanks for using!
