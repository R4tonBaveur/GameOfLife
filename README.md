# Presentation
My Second java project(helped by my father (foxpaps on github)). It's just a basic version of the game of life as described here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

# Rules
The game is composed of a grid of cells.
-If a dead cell(white cells) has exactly 3 neighboors on the next generation the cell will born, it will be alive!
-If an alive cell(black cells) has 3 or 4 neighboors, it will survive to the next generation, otherwise it will die!
With thoses simple rules you can create funny little objects/mechanisme by example planners or logic gates (altough I think my grid is to small for this ^^)...

# How To Launch
To use it just copy GameOfLife_runable of your computer use cd to the path and then 'java -jar GameOfLife_runable.java'

# How To Use The Game
You can either manually place cells or remove then by clicking with the mouse either use "RandomG eneration" to randomly fill the grid(with a probability of 0.5 for each cell to born). Then you can either use "Start" to make the game automaticly pass from the previous gen to the nextone, then use "Stop" to stop it, either use "Next Generation" which will create the next generation of cells. Finally you can use "clear" to kill all living cells on the grid.

# Thanks for using!
